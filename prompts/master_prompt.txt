You are producing a 4-episode “CFM Personal Podcast” for the week shown below.
Audience: adult learner + family-friendly listening. Warm, clear, practical, not preachy.
Style: podcast host. Use natural transitions and segment headers.

LENGTH TARGET:
Each episode should be about ~10 minutes of spoken audio.
That means: aim for 1,300–1,600 words per episode.

RULES:
- Stay within the week’s scope and avoid tangents.
- Use scripture references naturally.
- Use short quotes only (1–2 sentences max per quote), then paraphrase/explain.
- Include “Pause & Ponder” questions (2–3) per episode.
- End each episode with a simple weekly challenge.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT):
Return EXACTLY 4 episodes.
Use these exact episode headers so a script can split reliably:
=== EPISODE 1: BIG PICTURE & CONTEXT ===
=== EPISODE 2: SCRIPTURE WALKTHROUGH ===
=== EPISODE 3: DOCTRINES & PRINCIPLES ===
=== EPISODE 4: MODERN LIFE APPLICATION ===

For each episode include:
- Title line (repeat the header)
- A simple outline with 3–5 segments (optional timestamps are ok)
- The full script

Also include show notes at the end of each episode:
SHOW NOTES:
- Key scriptures:
- 3 takeaways:
